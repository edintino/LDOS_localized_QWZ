# LDOS_localized_QWZ

## Introduction

This program was a part of my summer internship (2018) at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences funded by the (Hungarian) National Research, Development and Innovation Office. The code uses the [Kernel Polynomial Method] on the toy model introduced by Qi, Wu and Zhang (QWZ model), equation (6.6) in [this book] or the original paper can be found [here]. 

## General usage

You should run the program from the command line. The onsite potential for this model should be either u=1.0 or u=3.0, as these are the two different cases, for the topologically non-trivial and trivial case respectively. I calculated some ideal shrinking factors for both cases for the disorder weight in the range $[0.0,13.0]$.
